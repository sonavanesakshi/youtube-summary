The Transcript Generator and Machine Translator is an AI-powered tool that enhances the way users interact with online video content. With the exponential growth of long-form videos on platforms like YouTube, it becomes increasingly time-consuming and inefficient to watch entire videos just to find relevant information. This project addresses that challenge by:
Extracting transcripts from YouTube videos using Python APIs.
Summarizing the extracted transcripts using pre-trained NLP models (like T5 from HuggingFace Transformers).
Translating the summarized text into multiple languages including English, Hindi, and Marathi.
To improve accessibility and usability, a Chrome Extension is integrated, allowing users to generate summaries and translations in real time directly while watching videos in the browser.
This tool is especially beneficial for students, educators, researchers, and general users seeking to save time, overcome language barriers, and quickly grasp the content of long videos.
